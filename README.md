# O3 Vs. Deepseek



Prompt: 
Create an interactive Python game that simulates mountain biking through rugged terrain. The player controls the bikeâ€™s speed and tilt to navigate steep climbs, sharp descents, and various obstacles. The simulation should include realistic physics, such as momentum, friction, and balance. The game should feature detailed visualisations with smooth animations, real-time terrain interactions, and interactive controls. The objective could be to reach the finish line without crashing or to complete the course in the shortest time while collecting bonuses along the way. there should not be any crashing or loosing, just riding the bike in mountains.
